If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA

[2024-04-02 05:52:46 UTC] Nightbot: Just an FYI pepegaplayer123, Hair grows everywhere on the human skin except on places like the palms of our hands and the soles of our feet, our eyelids and belly buttons, but many hairs are so fine they're virtually invisible. Hair is made up of a protein called keratin that is produced in hair follicles in the outer layer of skin. As follicles produce new hair cells, old cells are being pushed out through the surface of the skin at the rate of about six inch a year. The more you know

[2024-04-02 07:09:11 UTC] xKimper: tornados are caused by nascar races cause the cars go so fast in circles it creates an upper vortex that makes the air hot in the middle and cold on the outside. so when the cars leave the track the left over methanol burns into the atmosphere creating the tornado
